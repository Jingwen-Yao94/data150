1.Zhenjun Zhu, Zhigang Li, Hongsheng Chen, Ye Liu, JunZeng. Subjective well-being in China: how much does commuting matter?
In this article, the authors first point out a problem in China’s current development process that it ignores vulnerable groups’ traffic need as the rapidly increasing urbanization and motorization. They offered vivid statistic evidence to prove that subjective well-being of residents could be influenced by commute time through the comparison between urban respondents’ daily average commuting time with rural respondents. The final result shows that the longer the commute time, the lower the subjective well-being. Furthermore, the subjective well-being of residents who choose to commute by walking or cycling is significantly lower than that of those who commute by other transportation modes.

By introducing the development problem currently in China, the authors show the audiences with valid fact that the cost related to traffic congestion in Beijing has reduced the municipal gross domestic product by 4-7 percent. Through using especially designed web-based and paper-based surveys, the authors argue that the commuting mode choice significant influence subjective well-being. I regard them as two types human development mentioned by Amartya Sen in his book Development as freedom. The former one considers development in a narrower way that cares about the economic growth or loss of one country while the latter one cares about personal satisfaction towards life, which may be a higher level of freedom. Improving in the problem of long commuting time will lead to not only a more efficient society with higher level of total output, but also a more satisfying country that provide the residence with more freedom. For the datasets the article uses, the authors obtain the data from the 2014 China Labor-Force Dynamics Survey which is a nation cross sectional survey covering 29 mainland provinces, with multistage clustering and a stratified probability sampling strategy. The databases include individual socioeconomic status, commuting situation, working conditions and other demographic information through a random sampling method from three levels—individual, neighborhood, and city. Finally, what can we actually learn from this problem that emerges during the process of development? The authors briefly mention three specific policy suggestions, like shortening the distance between employment and residence locations or avoiding mixing bike and car lanes. They may be useful in specific regions and what we should really learn from the problem is actually to take advantage of transportation modeling, which uses scientific method to plan the transportation system in order to not only save money for the government, but also provide all residents with high-quality transportation services.


2.Transportation in Developing Countries: Obvious Problems, Possible Solutions

In this article, the author is seeking to bring people’s attention to one of chief tasks confronting governments in developing countries, which is transportation problems. The author first introduces the background and significance of transportation issue. First, transportation directly contributes to the economic growth and specialization associated with urban areas. More importantly, transportation facilities expand the options for work, education, health, and other amenities and directly affect the economic efficiency of cities and the well-being of their inhabitants. However, because of the limited amounted of resources developing countries owned, how to provide their citizens with minimal transportation facilities becomes a critical question to the government. Furthermore, as the rapidly development of urbanization in the world, the most reliable forecasts indicate that by the turn of the century almost half of humanity will live in urban centers. The rate of population growth is also larger as opposed to that in developed countries and this disparity seems to expand. As mentioned by the author, these figures suggest that developing countries must increase their capability to supply and effectively manage their urban infrastructure by at least 75 percent merely to maintain their current level of service, which, to say the least, is woefully inadequate. Along with the fact that despite ranging from 15 to 25 percent of some developing countries’ total expenditures is spent on transportation system, the current situation seems to get worse. Things could be even harder for the poor since even if transport were provided by the government, a large proportion of the poor would not be able to afford it. The poor can only afford to walk or bicycle. Based on these facts, the author underlines the necessity of providing facilities for nonmotorized travel and attention should be placed on projects that provide transportation directly to the urban poor. Because of the nature that resources are rare in those developing counties, some projects that can immediately improve conditions for the poor may be a good idea.

In my opinion, the lack of transportation could be a kind of unfreedom for people. Though it seemingly may not cause any direct loss to people, the possibility that people may be not able to get education, health care and the loss in economic growth can not be ignored. Just as Amartya Sen mentioned in the book, transportation could also be a part of “human resource development” that should be considered even before the development in economics. What I think this article lack of is some more practical and reasonable solutions for the problem he raised.
